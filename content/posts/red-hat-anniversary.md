I recently received an email reminding me that I'm a Red Hatter for ONE YEAR already.

> Congratulations Robert,
> You’ve been a Red Hatter for 1 year! Today, we are celebrating your service to Red Hat and dedication to our mission.
> Your virtual puck is attached. Thank you for contributing to our success and helping to make Red Hat the best place to make a difference together!

By reading the email and inspecting my received virtual puck, I kept holding myself back for a moment and started realizing what a hell of a journey my carreer in tech has been so far.

If you know me, you might also know my past with VMware. [Leaving VMware](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertguske_vmware-vcommunity-grateful-activity-7256685239232606211-d93Y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABwRXeQB4ezoeTMEqEGTf7Rl0JjiBDivw_s) wasn't easy at all for me. Feelings-wise, it was a heavy ride on a rollercoaster. Evidence of this was reflected in my extremely low level of activity on popular social media platforms and on my blog. The more it was important to feel home again.

**Joining Red Hat in November 2024, made me feel home again.**

Looking back on my first 12 months at Red Hat, I feel genuinely grateful to be part of something that’s not only big in scale, but truly meaningful in impact. Red Hat isn’t just “another tech company” to me! It’s a place where open source, community, and collaboration aren’t slogans on a slide deck, but the way we actually work every day.

From day one, I noticed how deeply the idea of open runs through the company. Red Hat describes itself as an open organization, where collaboration and openness shape how people work together, what we build, and the value we create for customers and the world. I’ve experienced it in countless moments: from open discussions on mailing lists and chats, to architecture reviews where anyone can ask tough questions, to business units and leaders who share context.

One statement that really resonates with me is Red Hat’s belief that [“Open source unlocks potential](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/our-culture)”.

 Over this past year, I’ve seen how seriously the company lives that purpose. The commitment to open source clearly goes beyond technology—it shapes how teams are formed, how ideas are evaluated, and how decisions are made. Instead of top-down directives, there’s a genuine effort to include diverse perspectives and to treat good ideas as something that can come from anywhere, regardless of title or role.

I’m especially proud to be part of a company that uses a community-powered approach to build enterprise solutions that the world relies on. Red Hat is widely recognized as the leading provider of enterprise open source software, using this community-driven model to deliver reliable, high-performing Linux, hybrid cloud, container, and Kubernetes technologies.

 Being on the inside, you really feel that connection between upstream communities, customers, and internal teams—it’s a loop of feedback, contribution, and collaboration that keeps things honest and innovative.

Culture-wise, joining Red Hat has been a bit of a paradigm shift for me. The open source way here isn’t just about publishing code. It’s about principles like transparency, participation, and meritocracy being baked into everyday work.

 I’ve been encouraged to speak up, challenge assumptions, and share my ideas even when I’m the “new person in the room.” At the same time, people are incredibly generous with their knowledge. Documentation, internal discussions, and even decision rationales are shared widely, so everyone can learn and understand the bigger picture.

One thing I really appreciate is how Red Hat talks about open source as more than a methodology—“it’s an attitude.”

 That attitude shows up in small details, like how teams default to working in public channels instead of private ones, how feedback is given openly but respectfully, and how experiments and failures are treated as part of the learning process. There’s a strong sense that we’re all stewards of something bigger than ourselves: the communities we work with, the products we ship, and the ecosystem we help build.

Over this past year, I’ve had the chance to learn from incredibly passionate colleagues, contribute to projects that matter, and see firsthand how an open organizational culture can drive both innovation and resilience. Red Hat often talks about using open source principles across the organization to maximize flexibility, transparency, and speed—and I can honestly say I’ve felt all three in my day-to-day work.

So, as I celebrate my first anniversary, I mainly want to say thank you:

To my teammates and mentors who’ve answered endless questions, shared context, and trusted me with real responsibilities.

To the broader Red Hat community—inside and outside the company—for showing what’s possible when we build together, in the open.

And to everyone who keeps our culture grounded in the belief that openness isn’t just the best way to build software, but a powerful way to work and to lead.

Here’s to year one at Red Hat—rooted in open source, powered by community—and to many more years of learning, contributing, and helping “open unlock the world’s potential.” 💫
